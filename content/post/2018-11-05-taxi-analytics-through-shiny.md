Taxi Industry & Indicators

The Taxi & Limousine Commission of New York City (TLC) is the regulating body for all taxi and for hire vehicle service. In order to understand the industry they regulate data collection is key and quick metrics are important for tracking and getting ahead of shifts in an industry. TLC releases [industry indicators](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/technology/aggregated_data.shtml).

In order to make this easier for the public, I created the [tlc fast dash](https://tlcanalytics.shinyapps.io/tlc_fast_dash/), a simple shiny application meant to help visualize these metrics for rapid use. The source code is available through the app or you can [click right here](https://gitlab.com/maverick_tlc/tlc_fast_dash). You can also see the official post at the [tlc medium blog](https://medium.com/@NYCTLC/simple-to-use-visualizations-for-trip-trends-6dd35ae1f247)
