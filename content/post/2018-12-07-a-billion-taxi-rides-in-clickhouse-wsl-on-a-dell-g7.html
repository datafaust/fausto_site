<h2>Why ClickHouse?</h2>
<p>Recently I’ve been wanting to expand my knowledge of other database types beyond SQL variants and map reduce methods with spark. As a data sceintist at the Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission I follow some of the work that is done by the public using our data and have followed <a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/">Mark Litwintschik’s blog</a> blog for some time. At work we currently lean on SQL Server and PostgreSQL along with Python and R for most of our analyses but I’ve been curious about incentivizing change (albeit a resistant IT department as many of you probably have).</p>
<p>In 2017 Mark benchmarked 1.1 billion taxi rides using <a href="https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data">Todd Schneider’s</a> ETL scripts with our public data. It’s been some time but I thought I’d give it a shot myself, particularly since I was intrigued by the performance gains over postgres and even spark on a single node machine.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to spin up a cluster on Amazon to pay at the moment, ot to mention all the storage I would need to buy, so I decided to run this on my Dell G7 laptop which has some impresive specs for a cheap laptop:</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Since clickhouse only runs on linux distributions I chose to run it on Ubuntu 18.04 on WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux). The reason I didn’t choose virtualbox was because I wanted to leverage the full power on my computer, and later test Windows HouseOps functionality to access the server locally, a nifty setup to convince the higher ups to use this.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-wsl-up-and-running" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting WSL up and Running</h2>
<p>Installing wsl in windows is simple, with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">documentation here</a>. Simply activate via powershell and then install through the windows store (choice 1 from the 3 choices listed in the documentation).</p>
<p>Once Ubuntu is installed, you’ll want to open up ubuntu through cortana and begin standard linux setup, adding in your password and user information. You’ll want to run the usual update and upgrade values:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</code></p>
<p>Since I was just testing out the system and wsl is behind windows firewall I didn’t setup any firewalls or security.</p>
</div>
<div id="postgresql" class="section level2">
<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>I followed Mark’s blog on coding the data through <a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-redshift.html">postgres</a> in order to produce the gz files we will load into clickhouse. You can follow the instructions there but here is a short summary of what to do. You’ll want to install postgres client and server. In ubuntu, make a directory for the taxi data and clone Todd’s repo (note I chose to place my files in windows in order to play around with accessing files across platforms; this means you will need to access the windows files directories):</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install postgresql</code> <code>mkdir /mnt/c/Users/0000/Desktop/Documents</code> <code>cd /mnt/c/Users/0000/Desktop/Documents/nyc-taxi-data</code> <code>git clone https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data.git</code> <code>cd /mnt/c/Users/0000/Desktop/Documents/nyc-taxi-data</code></p>
<p>you’ll download the data automatically, but remember that Todd’s script pulls the urls of ALL the trip records. If you just want to test first with only a year or so of data I reccomend opening the url script with something like:</p>
<p><code>sudo nano /mnt/c/Users/0000/Desktop/Documents/nyc-taxi-data/setup_files/raw_data_urls.txt</code></p>
<p>and deleting as many files as you wish, so you can run:</p>
<p><code>./download_raw_data.sh &amp;&amp; ./remove_bad_rows.sh</code></p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded the data, you can run the initialize and import scripts:</p>
<p><code>./import_trip_data.sh</code> <code>./import_fhv_trip_data.sh</code></p>
<p>I chose to do this in chunks as I did not have the hard drive space in place. This is definately the longest part of the process. Once it’s done, you will now have a postgresql database with all the data loaded in which you can query. This means we can pull the data out and compress it into .gz files which will be loaded into clickhouse. You’ll want to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>create the directory: <code>mkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/0000/Desktop/Documents/nyc-taxi-data/trips</code></li>
<li>add permissions to write to the directory: <code>sudo chown -R postgres:postgres \</code> <code>/mnt/c/Users/0000/Desktop/Documents/nyc-taxi-data/trips</code></li>
<li>enter postgres: <code>psql nyc-taxi-data</code></li>
</ol>
<p>And then run the script to pull the data:</p>

<p>Once you finish downloading the files you are read to load them into clickhouse. The beauty of these files is that you can use them again and again to explore some of the other databases that Mark benchmarks or otherwise explore options you may want to try.</p>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-clickhouse-in-wsl" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up clickhouse in wsl</h2>
<p>This was certainly the trickiest part of this porcess. Clickhouse <a href="https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/getting_started/">documentation</a> asks for the following code segments:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>deb http://repo.yandex.ru/clickhouse/deb/stable/ main/
sudo apt-get install dirmngr    # optional
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv E0C56BD4    # optional
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clickhouse-client clickhouse-server</code></pre>
<p>If you run these in wsl you will receive an error that says dbgmanager is not installed. WSL to my knowledge has not solved CURL issues through dbmanager so changing keys from sources proves difficult. There are a few options noted in serveral forums that you can see <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/3286">here</a>, but in my case I decided to install clickhouse manually. Simply go to the <a href="http://repo.yandex.ru/clickhouse/deb/stable/main/">repository</a> and install matching versions, of the commons, server and client:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>clickhouse-common-static_19.1.6_amd64.deb
clickhouse-server_19.1.6_all.deb
clickhouse-client_19.1.6_all.deb</code></pre>
<p>In my case they hit the downloads folder which you can reference and install:</p>
<p><code>cd /mnt/c/Users/0000/Desktop/Downloads</code> <code>sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file</code></p>
<p>Note you will do this for al three files. Follow the prompts and you should be able to install the software without a hitch. Once everything is installed, start the service:</p>
<p><code>sudo service clickhouse-server start</code></p>
<p>Start the client:</p>
<p><code>clickhouse client</code></p>
<p>You are now in the equivalent of the psql database in clickhouse.In here you can run all your database queries, you can create a database and begin making tables. You will want to create the trips table in order to populate it with the data from the .gz files. You can run the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>CREATE TABLE trips (
    id                      UInt32,
    vendor_id               String,

) ENGINE = Log;</code></pre>
<p>and you should receive the following message:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/clickhouse_single_node/create_table.png" />

</div>
<p>You should be all set now to load the trips.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-the-data-into-clickhouse" class="section level2">
<h2>Loading the data into clickhouse</h2>
<p>Loading the data into clickhouse requires editing some of the fields in the trip data. Mark writes:</p>
<p>-The dataset itself uses commas for delimiting fields. None of the contents of the data contains any commas themselves so there is no quotations used to aid escaping data. NULL values are defined by the simple absence of any content between the comma delimiters. Normally this isn’t an issue but with ClickHouse empty fields won’t be treated as NULLs in order to avoid ambiguity with empty strings. For this reason I need to pipe the data through a transformation script that will replace all empty values with .</p>
<p>So in order to fix this we run his script. You will want to make sure that you install python and create the script:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install python</code> <code>sudo nano trans.py</code></p>
<p>and then paste in the script text:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>import sys


for line in sys.stdin:
    print &#39;,&#39;.join([item if len(item.strip()) else &#39;\N&#39;
                    for item in line.strip().split(&#39;,&#39;)])</code></pre>
<p>Now you can run the upload script:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>time (for filename in /mnt/c/Users/0000/Desktop/Documents/nyc-taxi-data/trips/trips_x*.csv.gz; do
            gunzip -c $filename | \
                python trans.py | \
                clickhouse-client \
                    --query=&quot;INSERT INTO trips FORMAT CSV&quot;
        done)</code></pre>
<p>You should now see clickhouse loading and processing data. This will vary on the amount of data but shouldn’t take more than a few hours tops.</p>
</div>
<div id="query-and-test" class="section level2">
<h2>Query and Test</h2>
<p>You can take this a step further, creating a mergetree table and tuning up. But you will want to run a few tests first. You can go head and access the data with some basic queries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>----cab type
SELECT cab_type, count(*)
FROM trips
GROUP BY cab_type

----puloc double group by
select 
pickup_location_id,
cab_type,
count(pickup_datetime)
FROM
trips
group by
pickup_location_id,
cab_type</code></pre>
<p>You should see these queries run in a few seconds depending on how much data you loaded.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions-and-next-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusions and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Ultimately this is a very powerful software, particularly for low-resource departments with big data usage. This setup is certainly not the most optimal, but for quick access to large data for the average person, clickhouse seems to be a very powerful tool with great potential. A better setup would leverage pure linux distributions, but this can be a great option for organizations which for security reasons may not be able to run linux outside of a windows environment.In the next step I will try and run Tabix, which is a third party gui meant to allow for access of clickhouse data as well as test R and Python access to clickhouse via wsl. Stay tuned!</p>
